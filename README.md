# Customer_Churn_Prediction

It is easier for a telecommunications company to retain existing subscribers than to acquire new subscribers.
Likewise, it is easier to persuade a customer to stay when they have decided to leave than it is to persuade them to return after the customer has left.
No company likes to lose customers.

The cost to companies of customers' withdrawal is heavy.
For this reason, it is necessary to analyze customer behavior, to predict the high probability of withdrawal, and to persuade them not to leave.

In this project, the customer information in the dataset containing the information of Telco company's customers analyzed and it is estimated whether the customers will withdraw. By analyzing the results obtained, it will be revealed which customers are prone to withdrawal.
